        <div class="gst-container">
            <div class="gst-theory">
                <br>
                <p>All suppliers of goods or services create GST invoices
                    on a daily
                    basis, but hopefully hey also
                    get paid by their clients. This means that when you receive a payment for one of your invoices,
                    you should issue a receipt voucher.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>What is a payment voucher?</h3>
                <p>A receipt, also known as payment voucher, is a document which attests that a payment has been made to
                    confirm a supply of goods / services. In the case of goods, a receipt serves the purpose of proof of
                    ownership. A receipt is a legally binding commercial document that is used to prove that goods or
                    services of a certain value have been received and paid for.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Invoice vs Receipt (Payment Voucher)</h3>
                <p>During a sale, a supplier and a buyer enter into a business arrangement that usually includes a
                    written agreement outlining the transaction terms. These agreements typically involve invoices and
                    receipts.</p>
                <p>An invoice, also called a bill, is used in accounting to record a sale transaction, whereas a receipt
                    is used to account for payments. Simply put, an invoice is issued before payment, while a receipt is
                    issued after payment.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>GST Advance Payment Receipt</h3>
                <p>When a customer makes an advance payment, tax liability arises before issuing an invoice and
                    supplying goods or services. This payment must be recorded in accounting, as the bank has already
                    registered the payment date.</p>
                <p>If the tax is not paid separately by the customer at the time of payment, the advance payment is
                    considered inclusive of tax. As per GST rules, the supplier must issue an advance receipt voucher to
                    the customer on the date of payment receipt. This voucher should have a unique serial number for the
                    financial year.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Receipt Voucher Format</h3>
                <p>As per clause (d) in subsection (3) of section 31 of the GST Act, a receipt voucher must contain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name, address, and GSTIN of the supplier</li>
                    <li>Unique serial number for the financial year</li>
                    <li>Date of issue</li>
                    <li>Name, address, and GSTIN (or UIN if unregistered) of the buyer</li>
                    <li>Description of goods or services</li>
                    <li>Advance payment amount</li>
                    <li>Tax rate (CGST, SGST/IGST/UTGST breakdown)</li>
                    <li>Place of supply with state name and code</li>
                    <li>Reverse charge applicability</li>
                    <li>Signature of the supplier or authorized representative</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3>Payment Report - Statement of Accounts</h3>
                <p>A statement of accounts is a detailed report of transactions related to a specific client. It
                    includes both billings and payments over a specific period, concluding with the ending balance. This
                    helps customers track pending sales and payments.</p>
                <p>A statement of accounts usually includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total of unpaid invoices</li>
                    <li>Invoice number, date, and total amount for each issued invoice</li>
                    <li>Credit note details (number, date, and amount issued)</li>
                    <li>Payment dates and total amounts received</li>
                    <li>Net remaining balance of all transactions</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3>How to Generate a Receipt Voucher or Get a Statement of Accounts?</h3>
                <p>A receipt voucher can be generated using billing software such as Sleek Bill, which ensures
                    compliance with GST rules. The software allows payments to be allocated across multiple invoices,
                    store remaining credits, and generate reports such as a statement of accounts.</p>
